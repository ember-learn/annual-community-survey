# Community Preview Weekend: 2019 Ember Community Survey

We are thrilled to announce that we will be adding to the Spring excitement surrounding octane and EmberConf 2019 with the release of our fifth annual Ember Community Survey, and as always, we want your input before we go live!

It is with this five-year milestone in mind that we have decided to centralize the survey process by porting to an official [annual community survey repo](https://github.com/ember-learn/annual-community-survey).

We’d like to get as much feedback as possible from the Ember Community before we go live, and we invite you to review [the tentative list of 2019 survey questions](https://github.com/ember-learn/annual-community-survey/blob/master/2019/survey-questions.md) this weekend and submit any feedback on the repo's [issues page]. We're hoping that this workflow will allow us to address community feedback more effectively, but more importantly, we are hoping that using a 'public forum' format for comments and suggestions will be a much more engaging experience than filling out a form or emailing an intern.

We're hoping for our biggest response rate in

Here are the key dates for this year's survey: 
* 02/13 - 02/17 : Survey question feedback
* 02/18 : Survey Distributed
* 02/18 - 03/08 : Survey open to the public
* 03/18 : Results distributed



* NB: Discord Stats

In 2015, over 900 participants answered roughly 35 questions about themselves, their Ember applications, and their businesses. You can find the 2015 results on our webpage.

In 2016, we doubled our participant count to over 1800, and dug a little deeper by asking participants approximately 50 questions. Needless to say, this information was very useful to the community. You can view the 2016 results here.

Before we go live with the 2017 survey w. We’re opening the survey up for comments. Please feel free to drop comments directly into the draft document. Your comments can be about anything from specific wording of the questions and answers to broader suggestions on what types of questions we should (or shouldn’t) be asking. What kind of information do you think will help us to better understand the Ember community so that we can improve and grow in 2017?

We’d like to see the response rate rise again this year! Once the survey is live, we’ll post the information on the emberjs.com website, as well as a variety of social media outlets. We hope you participate and encourage others in the Ember and JavaScript communities to participate as well.

The important dates are as follows:
