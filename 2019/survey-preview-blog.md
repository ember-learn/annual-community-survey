# Preview Weekend: 2019 Ember Community Survey

authors: Joseph Temple and Matthew Beale

We are thrilled to announce that we will be adding to the spring excitement
surrounding [Ember Octane](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/26c4d83fb66568e1087a05818fb39a307ebf8da8/text/0000-roadmap-2018.md)
and [EmberConf 2019](https://emberconf.com/) with the release of the fifth
annual Ember Community Survey, and as always, we want your input before we go
live!

In 2015 [201 Created](https://www.201-created.com/) began an annual survey of
the Ember community. Over the past four years data from the survey has helped
us measure progress on issues as wide ranging as diversity and browser support.
In 2017 free text responses were permitted for the first time giving community
participants a way to provide feedback to the project and project leadership a
new way to hear their voices. As 201 Created shuts down it feels like a good
time to promote the annual survey to an official project of the Ember Learning
Team. Thank you 201 Created team (and interns who worked on this) for our first
four years!

In 2019 the Ember community is more vibrant than ever, with over 3000 members
having joined the official Discord server (join via the [Ember Community page](https://www.emberjs.com/community/))
that launched last September. We're eager to hear how people are using Ember
and what they plan for the future.

We'd like to get as much feedback as possible about the content of the survey
before we go live. This year we're making an effort to move much of the survey
process to the [ember-learn/annual-community-survey GitHub repo](https://github.com/ember-learn/annual-community-survey).
Please review the [the list of 2019 survey questions](https://github.com/ember-learn/annual-community-survey/blob/master/2019/survey-questions.md)
this before February 17th and submit feedback as
[an issues on that repo](https://github.com/ember-learn/annual-community-survey/issues).

Here are the key dates for this year's survey: 

* 02/16 - 02/17 : Survey question feedback
* 02/18 - 03/08 : Survey open to the public for responses
* 03/19 : Results distributed in time for the EmberConf 2019 keynote!

Please join us in `#dev-ember-learning` on Discord if you have any questions
or other feedback for this year's survey.
