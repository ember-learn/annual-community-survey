# Community Preview Weekend: 2019 Ember Community Survey

We are thrilled to announce that we will be adding to the Spring excitement surrounding octane and EmberConf 2019 with the release of our fifth annual Ember Community Survey, and as always, we want your input before we go live!

It is with this five-year milestone in mind that we have decided to centralize the survey process by porting to an official [annual community survey repo](https://github.com/ember-learn/annual-community-survey).

We’d like to get as much feedback as possible from the Ember Community before we go live, and we invite you to review [the tentative list of 2019 survey questions](https://github.com/ember-learn/annual-community-survey/blob/master/2019/survey-questions.md) this weekend and submit any feedback on the repo's [issues page](https://github.com/ember-learn/annual-community-survey/issues). We're hoping that this workflow will allow us to address community feedback more effectively, but more importantly, we are hoping that using a 'public forum' format for comments and suggestions will be a much more engaging experience than filling out a form or emailing an intern.



Here are the key dates for this year's survey: 
* 02/13 - 02/17 : Survey question feedback
* 02/18 : Survey Distributed
* 02/18 - 03/08 : Survey open to the public
* 03/18 : Results distributed
