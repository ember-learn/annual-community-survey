We are back at it again this year, asking for your help in reviewing the Ember Community Survey draft!

Your input matters!

It’s been almost two years since we at 201 Created unveiled the results of the first Ember Community Survey at EmberConf.

In 2015, over 900 participants answered roughly 35 questions about themselves, their Ember applications, and their businesses. You can find the 2015 results on our webpage.

In 2016, we doubled our participant count to over 1800, and dug a little deeper by asking participants approximately 50 questions. Needless to say, this information was very useful to the community. You can view the 2016 results here.

Before we go live with the 2017 survey we’d like to get as much feedback as possible from the Ember Community. We’re opening the survey up for comments. Please feel free to drop comments directly into the draft document. Your comments can be about anything from specific wording of the questions and answers to broader suggestions on what types of questions we should (or shouldn’t) be asking. What kind of information do you think will help us to better understand the Ember community so that we can improve and grow in 2017?

We’d like to see the response rate rise again this year! Once the survey is live, we’ll post the information on the emberjs.com website, as well as a variety of social media outlets. We hope you participate and encourage others in the Ember and JavaScript communities to participate as well.

The important dates are as follows:

2/17 - 2/24, public review of the questions
2/27 - 3/21, the survey is open!
3/28 and 3/29, join us at EmberConf 2017 where we will share the results!
We appreciate your help in reviewing the draft document, and value any feedback you can provide!

If you have any questions or thoughts, you can reach myself and the rest of the 201 Created survey team at survey@201-created.com.

Update: The 2017 survey is live! Check it out at emberjs.com, and join us at EmberConf to see the live reveal of the results.
